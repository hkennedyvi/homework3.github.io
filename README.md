*The purpose of this project is to build upon the foundation on the website layout consisting of HTML & CSS by adding bootstrap elements. By doing so, the user experience becomes cleaner with responsiveness to different screen sizes and other bootstrap themed features (Ex: navbar).

*It consists of three common pages:
        About Me
        Portfolio 
        Contact

*The design of each page is consistent and modeled after screenshots of an existing website. Keeping the colors, fonts, and sizes the same creates a design theme. 

*The website is practice. The portfolio images are placeholders and the submission form does not have a destination. However, once the program is complete, this project will serve as a nice template to be further built out and act as an actual portfolio.
